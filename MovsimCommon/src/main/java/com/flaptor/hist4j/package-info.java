 * This package provides a histogram that adapts to any data distribution.
 * <p>
 * It has the following features:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>It adapts to any data distribution, keeping a more or less constant resolution throughout the data range by increasing the resolution
 * where the data is more dense.
 * <li>It can process large amounts of data with a very small memory footprint.
 * <li>It doesn't need pre- or post-processing to deliver statistics about the data seen so far.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The following statistics are available:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The accumulative density function for a given data point.
 * <li>The data point that splits the data set at a given percentile.
 * </ul>
